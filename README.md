dotfiles
========

Unix, Linux, and OS X configuration files.

I commonly use the following *nix tools:
- tmux
- minicom
- zsh
- emacs
- vim


And just like many on github, I drag these files pretty much everywhere I login.  Heck, the USB fob on my set of keys has most of these, might at well post them somewhere else where others can use them too.


Nothing too fancy, and as always, they are tweaked where every I go.
